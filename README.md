# My Diet
## A Mobile Web App to help one track their personal dieting goals, with a limited set of meals.

The intention for the first iteration is to create the application / ui around the idea that only a single user will be using the application. There will be a web interface to manage meals, and a mobile (iOS) optimized interface for tracking meal completion.

Scoring goes as follows:
  - Meal Completed: +1
  - Meal Skipped: 0
  - Meal Cheated: -1

The Idea, is to encourage the user to complete every meal as they themselves define it, without deviating. You can add meal options for each meal that will count as "complete". Over the course of a week, your score will be aggregated and you'll see a friendly icon (or message, as design is defined) that will indicate how well you are ( or aren't ) doing.

There are many planned features beyond the sub-title, including notifying the user of "bonus meals" earned through points, charts comparing weight against an affiliated withings scale, and possibly dealing with more complicated meals / ingredients. I am open to suggestions if you have any, and I'm only just starting out, so don't be afraid to tell me what you're looking for.

Yours -
